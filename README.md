# React Hooks Example 

This project is created using `create-react-app`. This is just a practice project developed to get the better understanding of react hooks.  

We are using useState, useEffects and useRef hooks for this example.

### Problem Statement
- Use github user API to render list of all users using React Hooks. 
- Add a delete button to remove the use from the DOM.
- Add some dynamic styling based on follower count or no of public repos.
- Add lazy loading to the component to render users on a button click.
- Add light and dark theme to the page.
- Add input box to enter custom user id and no of users per render. 
- Add lazy loading on scroll.
